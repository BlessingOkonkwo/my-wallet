## Atomic Design Methodology

The Wallet Dashboard Application is meticulously designed following the Atomic Design methodology. This approach organizes UI components into five distinct levels based on their complexity and reusability:

1. **Atoms:** Basic building blocks such as buttons, inputs, and icons.

2. **Molecules:** Small, functional components composed of multiple atoms, forming more complex UI elements like form controls.

3. **Organisms:** Larger components that combine molecules and atoms to create distinct sections of the UI, such as transaction lists or balance cards.

4. **Templates:** High-level wireframes that provide the structure for entire pages, arranging organisms in a coherent layout.

5. **Pages:** The final product, where templates are populated with actual content and data.

By adhering to the Atomic Design methodology, the application promotes consistency, scalability, and easier maintenance of its user interface.
